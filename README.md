# Namma_Yatri_Project
Namma Yatri is an application for taxi-based services like Ola and Uber in India, whereas it only has its business in Banglore and Mysore. On the website, it provides the data of its day-to-day as well as  all-time services. With this data, we can create a project using MSSQL for query and Power BI for visualisation.
